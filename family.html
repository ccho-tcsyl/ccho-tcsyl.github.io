          days that he doesn't have to go to work,he helps the rest of the family get around. He went to UCLA for college,
          but he used to play volleybal in highschool, so I practice with him in my backyard often. He is also VERY funny.</h4>

          She works hard everyday so that my brothers and I can have a comfortable life. My mom also went to UCLA with an
          art major. Once, she painted a very large painting, and now it is still hanging in our house. </h4>
